## 🚀 What I Do

I architect and automate cloud infrastructure at scale. I turn complex deployment challenges into elegant, repeatable processes. My sweet spot is the space where **infrastructure meets automation**.

```
Code → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor → Scale
```

## 💻 What I'm Building

### 🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline Automation**
Designing GitLab and GitHub workflows that handle testing, security scanning, and deployments automatically. Making developers' lives easier.

### ☸️ **Kubernetes at Scale**
Running containerized applications on Kubernetes. Learning about networking, storage, security, and making it production-ready.

### 🌍 **Infrastructure as Code**
Writing Terraform modules to spin up cloud infrastructure consistently across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

### 📊 **Monitoring & Alerts**
Building dashboards and alert systems so we know *exactly* what's happening in production, before users do.

## 🎯 How I Think

- **Automate first** - If you're doing it manually twice, automate it
- **Security always** - DevSecOps from the start, not as an afterthought
- **Monitor everything** - What you can't measure, you can't optimize
- **Keep it simple** - Complex infrastructure that breaks is worse than simple infrastructure that works
- **Document ruthlessly** - Good documentation is as valuable as good code
