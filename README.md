## 🚀 What I Do

I architect and automate cloud infrastructure at scale. I turn complex deployment challenges into elegant, repeatable processes. My sweet spot is the space where **infrastructure meets automation**.

## 🎯 My Engineering Philosophy

| Principle | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Automate first** | Manual processes are error-prone and don't scale. If you're doing it manually twice, automate it |
| **Security always** | DevSecOps from the start, not as an afterthought. Security decisions are made early |
| **Monitor everything** | What you can't measure, you can't optimize. Comprehensive visibility prevents surprises |
| **Keep it simple** | Complex infrastructure that breaks is worse than simple infrastructure that works reliably |
| **Document ruthlessly** | Good documentation is as valuable as good code. Clear docs prevent knowledge silos |
| **Reliability > Velocity** | Fast systems that break are worse than slow systems that work. Build for reliability first |

### Problem-First Thinking
Before implementing, I understand the underlying problem, constraints, and success metrics. A perfect solution to the wrong problem is still wrong.

### Root Cause Analysis
When things break, I dig deeper than the symptom. Understanding *why* systems fail prevents the same failure from happening again.

### Team Enablement
Good infrastructure serves the team. I build systems that make developers more productive, operations more reliable, and deployments more confident.
