## 💼 About Me

DevOps engineer with **2 years** of hands-on experience designing and automating cloud infrastructure. I specialize in turning complex deployment challenges into elegant, repeatable processes.

My focus: the intersection of **infrastructure reliability** and **deployment velocity**.

```
Automate → Scale → Monitor → Optimize → Repeat
```

## 🎯 What I Deliver

### ⚡ CI/CD Pipeline Architecture
Designing sophisticated deployment pipelines with automated testing, security scanning, and rollback strategies across GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and ArgoCD.

### 🐳 Container Orchestration at Scale
Running production Kubernetes clusters with deep expertise in networking, storage, security policies, and resource optimization.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code
Writing production-grade Terraform modules that spin up entire cloud environments consistently and reproducibly across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

### 📊 Observability & Alerting
Building comprehensive monitoring ecosystems using Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack. Creating dashboards that tell the story of system health in real-time.

### 🔐 DevSecOps Implementation
Embedding security practices into infrastructure pipelines from day one—not as an afterthought.

## 💡 Engineering Philosophy

| Principle | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Automate or Die** | Manual processes are error-prone and don't scale. If it happens twice, automate it. |
| **Security by Default** | DevSecOps isn't an afterthought—it's built into every pipeline and infrastructure decision. |
| **Observe Everything** | What you can't measure, you can't optimize. Comprehensive monitoring prevents production fires. |
| **Simple > Complex** | A simple system that works beats a complex system that breaks. Maintainability is a feature. |
| **Document Relentlessly** | Code documents *how*; documentation explains *why*. Both are essential. |
